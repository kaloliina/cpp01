/* The assignment asked when itâ€™s best to use a pointer vs a reference for a weapon. 
There are two main reasons: 

- HumanA takes the weapon in its constructor and will always have it. 
  References must be bound to an existing object at construction and cannot be NULL, 
  so a reference works here.

- HumanB does not always have a weapon. References cannot be changed to point to NULL 
  or reassigned, so a pointer is needed to represent an optional weapon.

So basically if we removed the weapon object creation on main, we wouldn't have the object
weapon and nothing to reference to.
